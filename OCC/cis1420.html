      <p>90% of the time spent making this website went into getting the navbar to work.</p>
      <p>These 2 pages link back to each other, none of the other pages on the site link to these pages. This was intentional.</p>
      <p>I don't have any other courses this semester, and the stuff I like from previous classes can't be displayed on a github page.</p>
      <p>I've been using this site for the Advent of Code challenges. Not sure what will be there when you look at this but as of writing this it's 2023 Day 2.</p>
